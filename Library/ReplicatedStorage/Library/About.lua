            Answer = "First, your book is looked at by our review committee; they ensure your book follows Roblox's ToU and Community Guidelines. Next, a librarian will create your book at their workshop. Then, after about a week, the librarian will move it to “Book Purgatory”, essentially the waiting room for books. Finally, a book mover will move the book from purgatory into the library. Most of these will take varying amounts of time and I cannot assign a time length to them. The maximum your book will take to enter the library is about 1-3 months."
